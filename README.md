AI-Powered Scientific Calculator

Description
This is a fully functional scientific calculator that I built using vibe coding tools for my assignment. It's not just a basic calculator, it tracks your history and saves your previous calculations even if you refresh the page. I built it to test out how well AI agents can handle real-world app requirements like state management and mobile responsiveness.

Features
- Works just like a standard calculator (add, subtract, etc.)
- Includes scientific functions: Sin, Cos, Tan, Square Root, Power, Log, and Pi.
- History Sidebar: It shows your last 10 calculations so you don't lose track.
- Persistence: It saves your history to LocalStorage. If you reload the browser, your data is still there.
- Mobile Friendly: I made sure the buttons work on phone screens (had to fix a bug with this).
- Dark Mode

Technologies Used
- Tool: Bolt.new (StackBlitz)
- Framework: React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/kaan-ux/VibeCodedCalculator

2. Go into the project folder:
   cd VibeCodedCalculator

3. Install the dependencies:
   npm install

4. Start the app:
   npm run dev

Experience
This project was an experiment in letting AI handle the heavy lifting. I used Bolt.new to generate the core code and then focused on testing and fixing specific bugs, like the history feature not saving correctly at first. You can read the full story of how I built this in the EXPERIENCE.md file.
